# software-automation

Software-automation is based on Process and Artifact State Transition Abstraction (PASTA). A tool as well as a theory behind for design, modeling, process, code generation, and product line software development.

Introduction: Process and Artifact State Transition Abstraction (PASTA) is a methodology to do process definition, which can be use for work-flow application, and automatic code generation.

Goal of This Project: The PASTA used to be a proprietary software that contains model editor, control server, code generator, and document generator. These programs are implemented by MS VB.net or VC++. However, the PASTA is not limited in any language or platform. Two reasons are for hosting this PASTA open source project - (1) to implement and apply the PASTA theory to improve the software development and process; (2) to continuously research the PASTA theory.
